Inspired by the great play of the 2019 Wimbeldon Men's Singles Finals, I've decided to create a tennis scorecard / stat tracker. 

The project can be started by running 'npm run dev-server'.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev-server`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production creating a webpack bundle.js file.<br>
